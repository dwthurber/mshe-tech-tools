title: Guide to Transcribing Interviews
subtitle: Transcribing is a pain. It can take sometimes as long as 3-4 minutes for every 1 minute of audio to transcribe an interview depending on how fast you type and the audio quality of the interview. Be prepared for this. There isn't any magical way to make it better. Speech to text processors simply aren't good enough to do this for us yet. However, these tips and technology tools might help make transcribing a little easier.

<h3>Transcribing</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://otranscribe.com/" target="_blank">oTranscribe</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> and <a href="https://transcribe.wreally.com/" target="_blank">Wreally</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> are two solid free browser-based options. They feature simple interfaces that emphasize typing and have keyboard commands to slow down, speed up, pause, and jump back in the recording so that your hands never have to move off the keyboard as you transcribe. Wreally also lets you set up your own short hands for commonly used words or phrases that will autocomplete for you as you type.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Many apps used for recording interviews on your phone or computer also provide the ability to slow down recordings which helps some people when transcribing.&nbsp; <a href="http://sites.lafayette.edu/fllrc/files/2011/08/Tech-Tip_audioSlowdown.pdf" target="_blank">This guide</a>  <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> explains many of the common programs you can use to slow down audio and video.</li>

<p>Don't focus on every "um," ah," and "you know." It is important to have accurate transcripts for research integrity, but that doesn't mean you need to include every filler word that does not have substance. Focus on getting the content of the interview correct; not the pauses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, don't wait until the last minute. Transcribing is an activity that takes time and concentration. It can get very tedious very quickly and if you are getting tired and want the transcribing to be done, you are more likely to make mistakes. Instead, transcribe the interviews as you record them so that they are fresh in your mind and don't pile up for you to have to complete them all at once at the end.&nbsp;</p>
