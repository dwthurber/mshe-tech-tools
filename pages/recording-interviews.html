title: Guide to Recording Interviews
subtitle: When you need to record interviews, there are a lot of different ways to do it. Which one you choose depends on personal preference and the situation. When transcribing interviews, the accuracy of the transcript can depend on the quality of the recording. Poorly recorded interviews tend to have more errors and are usually incomplete due to in-audibles. A crisp-clear recording of an academic interview makes transcription of the interview easier and faster.

<p>Below are some tips for how to capture the best audio quality during your research interviews and suggestions for programs you can use to record and help you transcribe your interviews.</p>
<h3>Recording an interview in person</h3>
<h4>Find the right locations</h4>
<p>It's easy to overlook the location as an important part of the interview, but having a good, quiet place can have a major impact on the quality of a recording. While it&rsquo;s important to give choice to the interviewee in choosing an interview location, there are two venues you should avoid at all costs: </p>
<ol>
<li>Public places: restaurants, cafes, cars, et. al. These are venues where you have little or no control of the background noise and interruptions. </li>
<li>Outdoors: parks, sidewalks, on the beach, et. al. Again you have little or no control of the noise level.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Equipment</h4>
<p>You can record interviews using your smartphone, tablet, or computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-voice-memos-on-your-iphone.html" target="_blank">Voice Memo App on iPhones</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i>&nbsp;is built in. It is simple and straightforward and lacks some of the bells and whistles of some of the other options but has the advantage of being free and highly reliable</li>
<li><a href="http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14162&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fpio-smart-recorder%2Fid923119916%3Fmt%3D8" target="_blank">Pio Smart Recorder</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> (free for iOS) differs because it lets you tap to bookmark important sections of recordings. You just tap your iPhone screen to mark the spot where an interviewee starts talking or says something interesting, then tap the screen again to stop the recording.&nbsp;Later, Pio lets you go right to the good part instead of forcing you to listen to the full session. You can also use&nbsp;Pio to upload finished recordings to Dropbox or Google Drive (a one-time, $1 in-app purchase). The parts you bookmark are saved as individual audio files (.m4a), along with a file of the entire recording. You can also arrange recordings in project folders. The free app limits you to three project folders, but for $1 you can have an unlimited number.</li>
<li><a href="http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14162&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fvoice-record-pro%2Fid546983235%3Fmt%3D8" target="_blank">Voice Record Pro</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> (free; $3 removes adds) is another cool iOS audio recording app that's ideal for capturing voices and music. You can record in various audio formats (including MP3 and WAV) and export and import from or to Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box and SoundCloud. The app has a bookmarking feature as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both Pio and Voice Record Pro are iOS-only, but <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.androidapp.audiorecorder&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Audio Recorder</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrwq.recorder&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Smart Voice Recorder</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> are two good free options for Android which let you record audio and upload to Dropbox, Google Drive, or send and email with the recording attached.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you want more features, you can shell out $4 for&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digipom.easyvoicerecorder.pro&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Easy Voice Recorder Pro</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i>&nbsp;which&nbsp;is a quality Android option that records in multiple audio formats, lets you boost input volume and helps skip silent gaps in recordings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Computers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Macs, you can use the built in <a href="http://images.apple.com/ca/education/docs/teachers/Apple-GarageBandQuickStart.pdf" target="_blank">Garage Band</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> or <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2014/04/03/record-sound-mac-easy-quicktime/" target="_blank">QuickTime</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> to record audio.</li>
<li>On PCs you can use the built in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/record-audio-with-sound-recorder" target="_blank">Sound Recorder</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> program to record your audio.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Focus on the Interviewee</h4>
<p>The interview is all about the interviewee which means you should place your phone, computer, or whatever you are using to record audio closer to the interviewee; not right next to you.&nbsp;Their answers are more important than your questions. You already have some form of an &nbsp;interview guide with your questions written down that you can use as reference if your questions are not captured in the recording. So don&rsquo;t worry too much about capturing your questions, but be very concerned about accurately capturing the interviewees responses.</p>
<p>Let your interviewee talk. A lot of researchers tend to cloud out their respondents with questions and interruptions. Let them talk.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t jump in with questions. Use non verbal probes: nod, smile, tilt your head, raise your eyebrows, et. al. All these are great ways to enlist more information without interrupting the conversation. When you need to ask a question, wait until the interviewee has finished their thought, count to five and then ask the question.</p>
<h3>Recording an interview over the phone</h3>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way to record a phone interview is to put your phone on speaker phone and record using a second device, like your computer. This is definitely the easiest option, but audio quality is sometimes poor. If you do this, make sure you place the phone as close as possible to the input for the recording device and turn the volume on the phone all the way up. Even if it seems too loud for you in the room, the recording volume won't be as loud.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/115082?hl=en" target="_blank">Google voice offers free recording of incoming calls.</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> This is great, because it is free and immediate available. It's also super simple to initiate by hitting "4" on the phone keypad when you want to start the recording. However, <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/google-voice-for-mobile" target="_blank">you have to set up a google voice number</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> and it only works on incoming calls so the interviewee needs to initiate the call, or call you back in order to record the call.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Probably the highest quality option, though not free, is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tapeacall.com/buy/" target="_blank">TapeACall Pro</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> ($10 per year), which lets you record incoming and outgoing calls without paying the per-minute or per-call charges that are common in other similar apps. TapeACall Pro records calls by creating three-way connections between you and the people you call. Some setup is required for each recording as a result. Also, the recordings are processed on remote servers before they're available on your iPhone, but the processing doesn't usually take long.</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=polis.app.callrecorder&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Call Recorder</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i>&nbsp;(free on Android) also records calls and lets you protect access to the app and recordings with a passcode which is great for research data privacy and confidentiality. You can upload recordings to Dropbox or Google Drive. However, some manufacturers prevent users from recording calls built into their devices. A list of unsupported devices can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://clevermobile.net/products/call-recorder/call-recorder-list-of-non-supported-devices/%26sa%3DD%26usg%3DAFQjCNH1sYOl2pV6JnikXhmxxPR74pjuwg&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbeORXVhrEE-f_KkmTThlbi97PMQ" target="_blank">here</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i>.</li>
