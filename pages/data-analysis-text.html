<h3>Analyzing Text</h3>
<h4>Wordle (<a href="www.wordle.com" target="_blank">www.wordle.com</a>)</h4>
<p>Wordle is a fun (though non-scientific) way to analyze themes in text. Wordle will generate an image of words where the most frequently used words are larger. 
<p>To use wordle, follow these directions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on the <strong>create</strong> tab at the top.</li>
    <li>Paste in text from interview transcripts, your lit review or any other text you’d like to “analyze” and hit <strong>go</strong>.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> You will need to have (or download) a Java plugin. Mac users may encounter an issue with viewing the Wordle but this issue can be resolved. See trouble shooting tips at <a href="http://www.wordle.net/faq#redx" target="_blank">http://www.wordle.net/faq#redx</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Wordle will be generated in a random format which you can then modify. </li>
</ol>
